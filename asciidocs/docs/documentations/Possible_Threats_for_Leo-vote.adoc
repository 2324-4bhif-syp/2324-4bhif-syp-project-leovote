= Possible Threats for Leo-vote

== Man-in-the-Middle Attacks

Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks occurs when an attacker intercepts communication between the client and server, allowing them to modify the data being sent.

=== Mitigation

Implement HTTPS to encrypt communication.

Use secure authentication mechanisms that are provided separately from the “vote” data.

== Injection Attacks

Injection attacks involve injecting malicious code or SQL queries into the system to manipulate data.

=== Mitigation

Utilize parameterized queries or prepared statements.

Implement input validation and sanitization.

== Unauthorized Access (Admin)

Unauthorized access occurs when attackers gain access to the system and manipulate vote data directly.

=== Mitigation

Implement strong authentication mechanisms for the Admin Login, such as multi-factor authentication and self-changing passwords.

== 51% Attack

A 51% attack occurs when an attacker controls the majority of the computing power in the network, allowing them to manipulate the blockchain.

=== Mitigation

Implement mechanisms such as proof-of-work or proof-of-stake to make it economically infeasible for attackers to control the majority of the network.

== Social Engineering

Social engineering tactics, such as phishing or social manipulation to gain the Voter-Code could be used to gain unauthorized access to the system or manipulate the voting process.

=== Mitigation

Educate users about common social engineering tactics and how to recognize and avoid them. Use the school website as the only way to get to the voting page.
