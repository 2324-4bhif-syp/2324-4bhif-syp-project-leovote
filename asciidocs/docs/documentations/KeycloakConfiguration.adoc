== Keycloak setup

* Guide for local setup: https://www.keycloak.org/getting-started/getting-started-zip
* Download Keycloak from given website.
* Go into the downloaded keycloak folder and use these commands:

.After running these commands, keycloak will start, reachable via localhost:8080.

=== Admin Panel

. Create a new realm at the dropdown in the top left (Figure 2)
. Set the name for the realm (htl-leonding in our case) and switch the slider to enabled, to activate the realm. (Figure 3)
Hit the create button afterward.
. Switch to the created realm at the dropdown in the top left, and create a client. (Figure 4)
** Switch to the Clients tab and hit the Create client button.
. When you are in the Create client window, you have to set the ClientID and the Name (Figure 5)
** The ClientID is important, since this is registered in the identity provider.
** If you want to create a connection to the keycloak. You will need this aswell
** We set the ClientID to *leovote* for production and *leovotetest* for local development
** The Name field is only the displayed name in the admin panel
** The description contains some extra info you might need in your admin panel.
. When you hit next, you will get to some further configurations for the client. (Figure 6)
** In the capability config tab you can set the client authentication/authorization
** You can enable some login flows.
** We've only enabled the standard flow and the Direct access grants
*** Standard flow: Standard OpenId login flow
*** Direct access grants: The client has access to username/password and exchange it directly with
Keycloak server for access token.
*** Client Authentication is not needed, because we can't securely store the secret in the frontend.
. Click next, to get to the Login settings (Figure 7 / Figure 8)
** Root URL: Default Route to Client
** Home URL: The URL the Keycloak uses, when Keycloak needs to redirect to the Client.
** Valid redirect URIs: You can specify a URI pattern, where the browser can redirect to, after a successful login.
** Valid post logout redirect URIs: Valid URI pattern a browser can redirect to after a successful logout.
** Web origins: Allowed CORS origins. To permit all origins use a wildcard (*).
** Admin URL: URL to the admin interface of the client.
*** We have 2 configurations, one for local development, one for production.
*** See the configurations at the screenshot below. (Figure 7 / Figure 8)

== Frontend
* Found in:
** app.guard.ts in src/app/utils
** app.init.ts in src/app/utils
** environment.development.ts in src/environments (local development configuration)
** environment.ts in src/environments (production configuration)

****
* app.init.ts
** Configurations made in this file:
*** url: The URL where the keycloak is found. *(https://auth.htl-leonding.ac.at)*
*** realm: The realm for our project, which is set in the keycloak. *(htl-leonding)*
*** clientId: The clientID is the "name" of our project in the realm 'htl-leonding' in the keycloak.
**** We have two configurations. One for the deployed application on the server, and one for local development.
***** leovote (deployed)
***** leovotetest (local development)
**** These are set in the environment files
*** initOptions: the checkLoginIframe option is a iframe that is used to detect if a Single-Sign Out has occurred.

export function initializeKeycloak(keycloak: KeycloakService): () => Promise<boolean> {

****
* app.guard.ts
* Configurations:
** Set the keycloak login redirectURL.
*** This Setting forces the user to stay on login page, if currently unauthenticated.
** The roles, which are needed to successfully login are set.
*** This configuration loads the needed roles out of the route and checks if the user contains them. If so,
the user is allowed to proceed.

export class AuthGuard extends KeycloakAuthGuard {
  constructor(
    protected override readonly router: Router,
    protected readonly keycloak: KeycloakService
  ) {
    super(router, keycloak);
  }

  public async isAccessAllowed(
    route: ActivatedRouteSnapshot,
    state: RouterStateSnapshot
  ): Promise<boolean> {
    // Force the user to log in if currently unauthenticated.
    if (!this.authenticated) {

      return true;
    }

    // Allow the user to proceed if all the required roles are present.
    return requiredRoles.every((role) => this.roles.includes(role));
  }

IMPORTANT: There is no Client-Secret needed for the frontend configuration, since there is no safe way to save those.

== Backend
=== Keycloak

* The setup of the Keycloak client for out backend is pretty much the same, we just have to set some parameters in a different way.
* What's important: The Client for the backend and for the frontend have to be in the same realm.
* We have to differentiate between 'leovotetest' and 'leovote' clients like we had before, for local testing and deployed applications.

==== Differences:

* Activate Client Authentication & Authorization (Figure 9)

.Activate Client Auth
image::../images/backend_keycloak_auth.png[]

* Setup for local development
* The difference we have, is the URL. It now connects to 8080, instead of 4200, because it connects to our quarkus backend,
instead of a angular frontend. (Figure 10)

.paths
image::../images/backend_paths.png[]

* To connect to our Keycloak in our backend, we need to have some credentials.
* To set things up, we go in the credentials tab, and copy the secret, which we will use in our backend. (Figure 11)

.credentials
image::../images/credentials.png[]

* The Roles can be set in the 'Real Roles' Tab.
* Click on 'Create role' and set a name for the role. Then save it. (Figure 12)

.roles
image::../images/roles.png[]

* You have to permit roles to the users you got in your realm.
1. Go to the 'Users' Tab
2. Select the User (Klick on the User, or create a new one) (Figure 13)

.users
image::../images/users.png[]

1. Go to Role mapping tab inside the user (Figure 14).

.role mapping
image::../images/roles_tab.png[]

1. Click on 'Assign role' and filter by realm roles

.realm roles
image::../images/realm_roles.png[]

Then Check the ones you want to permit the user with.

=== Quarkus

* If you want to use the keycloak you have to set following configurations in the application properties. (Figure 16)

.application properties
image::../images/application_properties_OIDC.png[]

* auth-server-url: The url to the keycloak containing the realm name (testing).
* client-id: The name of the client we created (backend).
* credentials.secret: In there, we put our secret we got from the keycloak (in the credentials).
* tls.verification: At the moment we have no tls-verification, which is why we say 'none'.

==== POM

You will need following dependencies:

[source, xml]
----
        <dependency>
            <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
            <artifactId>quarkus-oidc</artifactId>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
            <artifactId>quarkus-keycloak-authorization</artifactId>
        </dependency>
----

==== Usage in API:

To block unauthorized users from accessing endpoints, they are nor supposed to, use the @RolesAllowed annotation.

[source, java]
----
    @GET
    @Path("getBySchoolId/{schoolId}")
    @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
    @RolesAllowed("admin-role")
    default Response getCandidatesBySchoolId(@PathParam("schoolId") String schoolId) {
        Candidate candidate = candidateRepository.getCandidateBySchoolId(schoolId);
        return Response.ok(candidate).build();
    }
