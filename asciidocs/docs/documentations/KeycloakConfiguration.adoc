== Keycloak setup

* Guide for local setup: https://www.keycloak.org/getting-started/getting-started-zip
* Download Keycloak from given website.
* Go into the downloaded keycloak folder and use these commands:

.After running these commands, keycloak will start, reachable via localhost:8080.

=== Admin Panel

. Create a new realm at the dropdown in the top left (Figure 2)
. Set the name for the realm (htl-leonding in our case) and switch the slider to enabled, to activate the realm. (Figure 3)
Hit the create button afterward.
. Switch to the created realm at the dropdown in the top left, and create a client. (Figure 4)
** Switch to the Clients tab and hit the Create client button.
. When you are in the Create client window, you have to set the ClientID and the Name (Figure 5)
** The ClientID is important, since this is registered in the identity provider.
** If you want to create a connection to the keycloak. You will need this aswell
** We set the ClientID to *leovote* for production and *leovotetest* for local development
** The Name field is only the displayed name in the admin panel
** The description contains some extra info you might need in your admin panel.
. When you hit next, you will get to some further configurations for the client. (Figure 6)
** In the capability config tab you can set the client authentication/authorization
** You can enable some login flows.
** We've only enabled the standard flow and the Direct access grants
*** Standard flow: Standard OpenId login flow
*** Direct access grants: The client has access to username/password and exchange it directly with
Keycloak server for access token.
*** Client Authentication is not needed, because we can't securely store the secret in the frontend.
. Click next, to get to the Login settings (Figure 7 / Figure 8)
** Root URL: Default Route to Client
** Home URL: The URL the Keycloak uses, when Keycloak needs to redirect to the Client.
** Valid redirect URIs: You can specify a URI pattern, where the browser can redirect to, after a successful login.
** Valid post logout redirect URIs: Valid URI pattern a browser can redirect to after a successful logout.
** Web origins: Allowed CORS origins. To permit all origins use a wildcard (*).
** Admin URL: URL to the admin interface of the client.
*** We have 2 configurations, one for local development, one for production.
*** See the configurations at the screenshot below. (Figure 7 / Figure 8)

** environment.development.ts in src/environments (local development configuration)
** environment.ts in src/environments (production configuration)

****
* app.init.ts
** Configurations made in this file:
*** url: The URL where the keycloak is found. *(https://auth.htl-leonding.ac.at)*
*** realm: The realm for our project, which is set in the keycloak. *(htl-leonding)*
*** clientId: The clientID is the "name" of our project in the realm 'htl-leonding' in the keycloak.
**** We have two configurations. One for the deployed application on the server, and one for local development.
***** leovote (deployed)
***** leovotetest (local development)
**** These are set in the environment files
*** initOptions: the checkLoginIframe option is a iframe that is used to detect if a Single-Sign Out has occurred.

****
* app.guard.ts
* Configurations:
** Set the keycloak login redirectURL.
*** This Setting forces the user to stay on login page, if currently unauthenticated.
** The roles, which are needed to successfully login are set.
*** This configuration loads the needed roles out of the route and checks if the user contains them. If so,
the user is allowed to proceed.

[source, javascript]
----
export class AuthGuard extends KeycloakAuthGuard {
  constructor(
    protected override readonly router: Router,
    protected readonly keycloak: KeycloakService
  ) {
    super(router, keycloak);
  }

  public async isAccessAllowed(
    route: ActivatedRouteSnapshot,
    state: RouterStateSnapshot
  ): Promise<boolean> {
    // Force the user to log in if currently unauthenticated.
    if (!this.authenticated) {
      await this.keycloak.login({
        redirectUri: window.location.origin + state.url
      });
    }

    // Get the roles required from the route.
    const requiredRoles = route.data["roles"];

    // Allow the user to proceed if no additional roles are required to access the route.
    if (!Array.isArray(requiredRoles) || requiredRoles.length === 0) {
      return true;
    }

    // Allow the user to proceed if all the required roles are present.
    return requiredRoles.every((role) => this.roles.includes(role));
  }
}

IMPORTANT: There is no Client-Secret needed for the frontend configuration, since there is no safe way to save those.
