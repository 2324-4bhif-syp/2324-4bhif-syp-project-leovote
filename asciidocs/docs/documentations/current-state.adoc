An Election defines the period during which votes can be cast, by whom, and for whom.
The Election contains the candidates available for selection and the email addresses of eligible voters.

Emails with a link to the vote can be sent through an email service.
After logging in via Keycloak, users can register for the election using their token (UUID).

Afterward, a vote can be cast, which will be added to the blockchain.

The election contains multiple candidates, where one can be selected.
The candidate selection view contains the participating candidates name, class and a picture.

== Architecture

* Backend
** Programmed in Java with Quarkus
*** Responsible for saving participants, emails, voter tokens.
**** The tokens are associated with the emails, to provoke people giving the code to other people
*** Saves Results and Votes from participants.
*** Checks if given code is associated with email.

* Frontend
** Admin View:
*** Create Candidates
**** Image Upload supported
*** Create Elections
*** Add Candidates to Elections
*** See results from elections
** Voter View:
*** Enter code sent via E-Mail
*** Select one of the participating candidates

== Problems

* CI/CD Pipeline (WIP)
* At the moment we only support to vote for a single person in one election.
* Backend endpoints not secured from outside. (ROLES)

== Future Plans

* Add point system, like in the school council election (HTL Leonding)
* Secure backend endpoints with roles (Authentication, Authorisation)
* Frontend design overwork
