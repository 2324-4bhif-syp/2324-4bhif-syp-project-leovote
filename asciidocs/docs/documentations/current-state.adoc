An Election defines the period during which votes can be cast, by whom, and for whom.
The Election contains the candidates available for selection and the email addresses of eligible voters.

Emails with a link to the vote can be sent through an email service.
After logging in via Keycloak, users can register for the election using their token (UUID).

Afterward, a vote can be cast, which will be added to the blockchain.

The election contains multiple candidates, where one can be selected.
The candidate selection view contains the participating candidates name, class and a picture.

== Problems

* CI/CD Pipeline WIP
* At the moment we only support to vote for a single person in one election.
* Backend endpoints not secured from outside. (ROLES)

== Future Plans

* Add point system, like in the school council election (HTL Leonding)
* Secure backend endpoints with roles (Authentication, Authorisation)
* Frontend design overwork
