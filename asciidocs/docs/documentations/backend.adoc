An Election defines the period during which votes can be cast, by whom, and for whom.
The Election contains the candidates available for selection and the email addresses of eligible voters.

Emails with a link to the vote can be sent through an email service.
After logging in via Keycloak, users can register for the election using their token.

Afterward, a vote can be cast, which will be added to the blockchain.
