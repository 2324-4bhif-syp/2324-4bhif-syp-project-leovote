= Documentation about the Safety of Leo-vote (13.02.24)


== What can happen?

* Somebody has the password to the voters Mail-Account.
** this is unfortunate, but we as Leo-Vote cant do much about it.
* Somebody starts a "Man in the middle" attack on the Voters.
** The "Vote" is intercepted and exchanged with the Vote of the Attacker.

== What can we do about it?
We could add a "Two-Factor" authentication:

For example:

* use the Name of the Voter
* use the SchoolID of the Voter
* use the BirthDay of the Voter


== Where could you use our Project with our current security?

* Class representative Votes

* "Klassenordner" Votes
